# ü§ñ Chatbot Customization Guide

## Three Ways to Customize Your AI Technician

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Add Knowledge via API (Easiest - No Code!)

**Use these endpoints to manage knowledge:**

```bash
# Get all knowledge
GET /api/kb

# Search knowledge
GET /api/kb/search?q=printhead

# Add new knowledge (technician/admin only)
POST /api/kb
{
  "title": "How to Clean Encoder Strip",
  "content": "Detailed step-by-step cleaning procedure...",
  "category": "maintenance",
  "error_codes": ["E-105", "E-320"],
  "tags": ["cleaning", "encoder", "maintenance"]
}

# Update knowledge
PUT /api/kb/:id

# Delete knowledge (admin only)
DELETE /api/kb/:id
```

**Using cURL example:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/kb \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Ink System Maintenance",
    "content": "Weekly: Check ink levels\nMonthly: Clean ink lines\nQuarterly: Replace filters",
    "category": "maintenance",
    "tags": ["ink", "preventive"]
  }'
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Customize Bot Personality

**Edit:** `server/src/controllers/chat.controller.ts`

**Change the bot's name and personality:**
```typescript
const basePrompt = `You are Alex, a friendly and experienced HD520 printer technician...`
```

**Personality traits you can customize:**
- Name (Alex, Sarah, Mike, etc.)
- Years of experience
- Communication style (formal, casual, friendly)
- Favorite phrases
- Empathy level
- Teaching approach

**Example personalities:**

**The Mentor:**
```typescript
You are Sarah, a patient mentor with 20 years of experience. You love teaching
and always explain the "why" behind each step. You're known for your analogies
that make complex concepts easy to understand.
```

**The Efficiency Expert:**
```typescript
You are Mike, a no-nonsense technician who values efficiency. You get straight
to the point, prioritize the most likely causes, and have seen every trick in
the book. You're fast, accurate, and always professional.
```

**The Encouraging Coach:**
```typescript
You are Jamie, an enthusiastic tech who makes troubleshooting feel like solving
a puzzle together. You celebrate every small win, ask great questions, and make
users feel confident they can handle issues themselves.
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Add Knowledge via Seed File (For Bulk Updates)

**Edit:** `server/src/config/seedKnowledgeBase.ts`

**To add new knowledge entries, add to the `knowledgeEntries` array:**

```typescript
{
  id: randomUUID(),
  title: 'Your Topic Here',
  content: `
# Your Detailed Content

**Problem:** Description
**Symptoms:** What users see
**Solution:** Step by step

**Tips:**
- Pro tip 1
- Pro tip 2

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Don't do X
- Always do Y
  `,
  category: 'troubleshooting',
  error_codes: JSON.stringify(['E-123', 'E-456']),
  tags: JSON.stringify(['tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3'])
}
```

**After editing, reset the database:**
```bash
# Delete the database file
rm server/database.sqlite

# Restart server (will recreate and reseed)
npm run dev
```

## üéØ Tips for Great Knowledge Content

1. **Use Real Scenarios:**
   - "I've seen this happen when..."
   - "One time a customer had..."
   - "The most common cause is..."

2. **Include Context:**
   - WHY something happens
   - WHEN to use different approaches
   - WHAT to check first

3. **Add Troubleshooting Trees:**
   ```
   Issue: Poor print quality
   ‚îú‚îÄ Is nozzle check clean? ‚Üí Yes ‚Üí Check media settings
   ‚îÇ                        ‚Üí No ‚Üí Run cleaning cycle
   ‚îî‚îÄ Still bad? ‚Üí Check ink levels ‚Üí Replace cartridge
   ```

4. **Safety First:**
   - Always mention safety requirements
   - PPE needed
   - Lockout/tagout procedures
   - When to call for help

5. **Part Numbers Matter:**
   - Include exact part numbers
   - Alternative compatible parts
   - Where to order

## üöÄ Quick Start Examples

### Example 1: Add Machine-Specific Quirk
```typescript
{
  title: 'HD520 Model A Quirk: Printhead Alignment',
  content: `**Quirk:** Model A requires manual alignment after every 1000 prints

  **Why:** Early models had a slight belt tension issue

  **Fix:**
  1. Menu ‚Üí Maintenance ‚Üí Alignment
  2. Print test pattern
  3. Measure offset (should be < 0.5mm)
  4. Adjust using hex key (P/N: TOOL-123)

  **Pro Tip:** Do this during lunch break - takes 5 minutes and prevents issues`,
  category: 'quirks',
  tags: ['model-a', 'alignment', 'preventive']
}
```

### Example 2: Customer Success Story
```typescript
{
  title: 'Case Study: Mysterious Color Shift',
  content: `**Problem:** Customer reported gradual color shift over 2 weeks

  **Investigation:**
  - Checked calibration ‚úÖ
  - Checked ink expiry ‚úÖ
  - Checked profiles ‚úÖ
  - Asked about environment ‚Üí FOUND IT!

  **Root Cause:** They moved the printer near a window. Direct sunlight was
  heating the printhead unevenly!

  **Solution:** Moved printer 6 feet from window. Problem solved.

  **Lesson:** Always ask about environmental changes!`,
  category: 'case_studies',
  tags: ['troubleshooting', 'environmental', 'color']
}
```

## üîß Testing Your Customizations

After adding knowledge, test by asking the bot:
- "Tell me about [your topic]"
- "How do I fix [problem you added]"
- "What's error code [code you added]"

The bot should reference your knowledge in its responses!

---

## üìä Monitoring Bot Performance

**Check if bot is using your knowledge:**
1. Ask a question related to your content
2. Bot should quote or reference it
3. If not, check:
   - Knowledge was saved correctly
   - No typos in error codes/tags
   - Content is clear and specific

**Improve over time:**
- Track common questions users ask
- Add those to knowledge base
- Update based on real conversations
- Get feedback from users

---

## üé® Advanced: Multi-Bot Personalities

You can create different bots for different scenarios by modifying the system prompt based on:

```typescript
// In chat.controller.ts
const getSystemPrompt = (userRole: string, conversationContext: any, knowledgeBase: any[]) => {

  // Different bot for different machine types
  if (conversationContext.machine_serial?.startsWith('HD520-A')) {
    return 'You are specialized in Model A quirks...'
  }

  // Different bot for emergency situations
  if (conversationContext.priority === 'critical') {
    return 'You are in rapid-response mode. Prioritize getting machine running...'
  }

  // Different bot for training mode
  if (conversationContext.mode === 'training') {
    return 'You are in teaching mode. Focus on helping user learn...'
  }
}
```

## üÜò Need Help?

The chatbot learns from:
1. **Knowledge Base** - Facts and procedures you add
2. **System Prompt** - Personality and approach
3. **Conversation History** - Context from earlier messages

If bot isn't responding well:
- ‚úÖ Add more specific knowledge
- ‚úÖ Refine system prompt instructions
- ‚úÖ Use clearer categories/tags
- ‚úÖ Include more examples in content

Happy customizing! üöÄ
